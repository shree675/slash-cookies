## About

A chrome extension to remove popups like cookies and other non-closable windows and refine webpages.

The extension will remember the elements marked as removed or refined. Hence, manual selection is required only for the first time (check the [demonstration](https://github.com/shree675/slash-cookies#demonstration) below).

## How To Use

1. Click on the extension icon.
2. Click on the red button to remove an element or the blue button to refine a window.
3. Hover over the popup or window using the mouse cursor.
4. Click on the selected popup or window to remove or refine it.

Optional:
* Uncheck *Save* to not save the current selection.
* Click on the eraser icon to clear the rules for the current web domain (URL).

Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> at any time to exit the process.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If clicking on the element does not work, press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to perform the action while hovering over the element.

The extension also displays a notification popup briefly to inform the user that certain HTML elements were hidden/modified as per the defined rules for a given web page.
